	<h3>Saftey</h3>
	<p>
		One good reason to use Ribbit is the security of the platform. Based on the very
		secure OpenRTC platform, your messages never touch our servers unencrypted. Only
		the sender and the recipient can view the messages. In a world where most messaging
		platforms read your chat logs to sell your data to add companies, Ribbit offers you complete peace of
		mind about the privacy of your discussions.
